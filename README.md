Mixed Content: The page at 'https://imaginative-licorice-69df63.netlify.app/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 'http://www.api.technicaltest.quadtheoryltd.com/api/Item?page=1&pageSize=10'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.

this is the api link you gave me but it is not working in netlify

"http://www.api.technicaltest.quadtheoryltd.com/api/Item?page=1&pageSize=10"
